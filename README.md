# Tic-Tac-Toe

In this project, we are going to represent the tic-tac-toe game board using an object, with 9 properties. Each property represents 1 box in the game board, in sequential order.

The name of the property represents the position of the box, while the value of the property represents who put their mark in the box (either “X” or “O” or “ “).
