# Tic-Tac-Toe

In this project, we are going to represent the tic-tac-toe game board using an object, with 9 properties. Each property represents 1 box in the game board, in sequential order.(See below on the usage of the data structure)

The name of the property represents the position of the box, while the value of the property represents who put their mark in the box (either “X” or “O” or “ “).

The project consists of 2 parts:

● Part 1: To build all the utility functions for this game including:

○ printBoard
○ validateMove
○ checkWin
○ checkFull, and
○ A constant variable storing all the winning combination
(winCombinations)
        
● Part 2: To complete the game play using the utility functions built in Part 1.
